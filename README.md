# Spotify Playlist from Artists

Creates a playlist from the top tracks of your chosen artists.

The artists uri file simply needs artists uris on separate lines. See the example (the artist names after the uri's aren't necessary but are helpful until I have a better method of modifying the file).

Requires spotipy (`pip install spotipy` or `pip3 install spotipy` - may need sudo).
